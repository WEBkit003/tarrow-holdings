                <hr class="first-hr">

                <p class="overlay__description">Manufactured to SANS 1253:2003 (edition 3) and stringently tested by the
                    SABS over the years with a proven
                    fire protection rate of two and a half hours. ROCKLITE® fire doors have many other advantages over
                    traditional fire doors. (Test Reports are available on both our ROCKLITE® single fire doors as well
                    as our
                    ROCKLITE® double fire door assemblies).</p>

                <p class="overlay__description">ROCKLITE® fire doors are lightweight, weighing only 29kg per standard
                    size panel, and are easy to install.
                    They are manufactured in a wide range of sizes and veneers to match existing surfaces.</p>

                <p class="overlay__description">ROCKLITE® fire doors are supplied with a purpose-made 1,6mm steel frame
                    with a 25mm rebate including one and
                    a half pairs of brass hinges. Frames can be manufactured to suite all wall requirements including
                    existing
                    wall openings and partitions.</p>

                <p class="overlay__description">Constructed with an inner monolithic, asbestos-free, fire resistant
                    core, ROCKLITE® fire doors have
                    reinforced steel inserts strategically located within the core material to strengthen hinging and
                    hydraulic
                    closure attachment.</p>

                <h2 class="overlay__title">National Test Standards:</h2>

                <p class="overlay__description">GENERAL REQUIREMENTS – fire doors of all classes shall be assembled in
                    the factory and supplied as a complete
                    pre-hung door. For the purpose of easy erection and to avoid damage during transportation or during
                    building
                    operations, the door may be taken out of the frame, provided that the frames and doors are
                    number-matched.
                    Locks and closers may also be fitted on site by qualified personnel, in accordance with the
                    manufacturer’s
                    instructions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>STABILITY – the door or assembly shall withstand the prescribed fire exposure and effectively
                        close an
                        opening without the doors moving out of the frame by more than 25mm.</li>
                    <li>INTEGRITY – the door or assembly shall withstand the prescribed fire exposure without the
                        development,
                        at any point of the door, of a straight-through gap of width that exceeds 6mm.</li>
                    <li>INSULATION – the door or assembly shall withstand the prescribed fire exposure without the mean
                        temperature of the exposed face rising to more than 140°C initial ambient temperature, or the
                        temperature at any point of the face rising to more than 180°C above initial temperature.</li>
                    <li>IMPACT TEST (class C & D assemblies only) – enables the door to resist two successive impacts of
                        a
                        sandbag 250 mm in diameter and a mass of 27kg without the formation of any opening wider than 25
                        mm.
                        This test, which is fully described in The South African National Standard – Section 5.5 and
                        5.6.</li>
                </ul>

                    and that is of the type required. The closing device shall close the door, even though the door may
                    have
                    been pushed open to the limit of its travel.</p>

                <h2 class="overlay__title">Fastenings:</h2>

                    allow the
                    door to be so installed that they can be easily opened in the direction of the escape without
